# Where and how to store data.
#
# Arbiters do not need journal files, nor data files.
# MongoDB does not know the instance is an arbiter until after it comes
# up and the primary instance adds it to the replica set.
# Preallocation of the journal file (in particular) and data file (less so)
# take a long time, so explicitly disable journaling and set data file
# preallocation to "small".

# MongoDB 3.0.x *debian* packages set bind_ip to 127.0.0.1 by default
# Compute Engine public addresses are properly firewalled by default
# set bind_ip to 0.0.0.0 to emulate pre-2.6 behavior which eases maintenance
