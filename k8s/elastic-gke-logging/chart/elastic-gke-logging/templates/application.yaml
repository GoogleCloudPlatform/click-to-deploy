      Elastic GKE Logging is an application that provides a fully functional solution for collecting
      and analyzing logs from a Kubernetes cluster. It is built on top of popular open-source systems,
      including Fluentd for logs collection and Elasticsearch with Kibana for searching and analyzing
      data.

      # Support
      Google does not offer support for this solution. However, community support is available on
      Stack Overflow for [Fluentd](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fluentd/),
      [Elasticsearch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/elasticsearch/) and

      # Access Kibana UI

      By default, the Kibana Service does not have an external IP. To open Kibana UI you can
      use `kubectl port-forward` and access the UI from your local machine.

      Run the following command in background:

      ```
      kubectl port-forward -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
        svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-kibana-svc 5601
      ```

      Open Kibana in your web browser with `http://localhost:5601/`.

      # Discover the logs

      ## Index Pattern

      Your installation automatically adds a default Index Pattern to be tracked by Kibana - it
      matches the Fluentd DaemonSet configuration and equals to `logstash-*`. Thanks to this
      configuration you can view the logs from the Kubernetes cluster immediately after the
      successful installation.

      ## Saved searches

      Kibana allows to save predefined searches with their filters and presented columns
      configuration. To view the searches shipped with this installation, visit the `Discover` page
      of Kibana and in the top menu, click on the `Open` option. It will present a list of some useful
      searches, including logs from: GKE Apps, kubelet, docker, kernel and others.
