      ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications. It exposes common
      services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - through a
      simple interface, so that you don't have to write them from scratch.

      You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence
      protocols. You can also build on it to fit your own specific needs.

      # Get authentication credentials for the cluster

      ```shell
      gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [CLUSTER_ZONE]
      ```

      where:
      * `[CLUSTER_NAME]` is the name of the cluster for this app
      * `[CLUSTER_ZONE]` is the zone in which the cluster is operating

      For more information, read the [instructions for getting authentication credentials for the cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart#get_authentication_credentials_for_the_cluster).
