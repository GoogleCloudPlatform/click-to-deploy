      Nuclio is a new serverless project, derived from Iguazio's elastic data life
      cycle management service for high-performance events and data processing.

      Nuclio lets you write source code defining functions in platform-specific
      conventions (including the triggers configuration and stateful data definition).
      Nuclio converts the source code into container images, stores them in a
      configurable Docker registry (for this app, Container Registry), and then
      deploys their workloads to a Kubernetes cluster.

      # Get access to the Nuclio Dashboard

      Run the following command to start port forwarding:

      ```shell
      kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} port-forward \
          service/{{ .Release.Name }}-dashboard 8070:8070
      ```

      # Get access to Nuclio by using `nuctl`

      `nuctl` is provided by the authors of Nuclio, and can be downloaded from the [official GitHub release page](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio/releases).

      `nuctl` will use the same credentials as those needed to access a Kubernetes\cluster using kubectl.

      The following is an example of how to use `nuctl` to list Nuclio functions:

      ```shell
      nuctl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} get function
      ```
