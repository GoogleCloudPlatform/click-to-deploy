      Nuclio is a new "serverless" project, derived from Iguazio's elastic data
      life-cycle management service for high-performance events and data processing.

      Nuclio allows to write a source code of functions defined in a platform-specific
      convention (including the triggers configuration or stateful data definition).
      Nuclio manages the conversion of the source code into container images (stored
      in a configurable Docker registry - for this application Google Container
      Registry) and deploying their workloads to a Kubernetes cluster.
