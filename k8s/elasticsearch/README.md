# Overview

Elasticsearch is an open-source search engine that provides a distributed, multitenant-capable
full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents..

## About Google Click to Deploy

Popular open stacks on Kubernetes packaged by Google.

# Installation

## Quick install with Google Cloud Marketplace

Get up and running with a few clicks! Install this Elasticsearch app to a
Google Kubernetes Engine cluster using Google Cloud Marketplace. Follow the
[on-screen instructions](https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/google/elasticsearch).

## Command line instructions

### Prerequisites

#### Set up command-line tools

You'll need the following tools in your development environment:
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

#### Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster

Create a new cluster from the command-line.

```shell
export CLUSTER=marketplace-cluster
export ZONE=us-west1-a

gcloud container clusters create "$CLUSTER" --zone "$ZONE"
```

Configure `kubectl` to talk to the new cluster.

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$CLUSTER"
```

#### Clone this repo

Clone this repo and the associated tools repo.

```shell
gcloud source repos clone google-click-to-deploy --project=k8s-marketplace-eap
gcloud source repos clone google-marketplace-k8s-app-tools --project=k8s-marketplace-eap
```

#### Install the Application resource definition

Do a one-time setup for your cluster to understand Application resources.

```shell
kubectl apply -f google-marketplace-k8s-app-tools/crd/*
```

The Application resource is defined by the
[Kubernetes SIG-apps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps)
community. The source code can be found on
[github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application).

### Install the Application

Navigate to the `elasticsearch` directory.

```shell
cd google-click-to-deploy/k8s/elasticsearch
```

#### Configure the app with environment variables

Choose the instance name and namespace for the app.

```shell
export APP_INSTANCE_NAME=elasticsearch-1
export NAMESPACE=default
```

Configure the container images.

```shell
export IMAGE_ELASTICSEARCH="gcr.io/k8s-marketplace-eap/google/elasticsearch:latest"
export IMAGE_INIT="gcr.io/k8s-marketplace-eap/google/elasticsearch/ubuntu16_04:latest"
```

The images above are referenced by
[tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag). It is strongly
recommended to pin each image to an immutable
[content digest](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#content-digests).
This will ensure that the installed application will always use the same images,
until you are ready to upgrade.

```shell
for i in "IMAGE_ELASTICSEARCH" "IMAGE_INIT"; do
  repo=`echo ${!i} | cut -d: -f1`;
  digest=`docker pull ${!i} | sed -n -e 's/Digest: //p'`;
  export $i="$repo@$digest";
  env | grep $i;
done
```

#### Expand the manifest template

Use `envsubst` to expand the template. It is recommended that you save the
expanded manifest file for future updates to the application.

```shell
awk 'BEGINFILE {print "---"}{print}' manifest/* \
  | envsubst '$APP_INSTANCE_NAME $NAMESPACE $IMAGE_ELASTICSEARCH $IMAGE_INIT' \
  > "${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}_manifest.yaml"
```

#### Apply to Kubernetes

Use `kubectl` to apply the manifest to your Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
kubectl apply -f "${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}_manifest.yaml" --namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
```

#### View the app in the Google Cloud Console

Point your browser to:

```shell
echo "https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/application/${ZONE}/${CLUSTER}/${NAMESPACE}/${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}"
```

### Expose Elasticsearch service

By default, the application does not have an external IP. Run the
following command to expose an external IP:

```
kubectl patch svc "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-elasticsearch-svc" \
  --namespace "$NAMESPACE" \
  -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

### Access Elasticsearch service

Get the external IP of the Elasticsearch service and visit
the URL printed below in your browser.

```
SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get \
  --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
  svc ${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}-elasticsearch-svc \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')

echo "http://${SERVICE_IP}:9200"
```

Note that it might take some time for the external IP to be provisioned.

### Scale the cluster

Scale the number of master node replicas by the following command:

```
kubectl scale statefulsets "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-elasticsearch" \
  --namespace "$NAMESPACE" --replicas=<new-replicas>
```

By default, there are 2 replicas to satisfy the minimum master quorum.
To increase resilience, it is recommended to scale the number of replicas
to at least 3.

For more information about the StatefulSets scaling, check the
[Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/scale-stateful-set/#kubectl-scale).
