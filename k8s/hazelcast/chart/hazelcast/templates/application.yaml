      Hazelcast IMDG (In-Memory Data Grid) is an in-memory data store, based on Java, which offers caching solutions
      to ensure that data is in the right place, when it’s needed, for optimal performance.

      # Support

      # Get the authentication credentials for the cluster
      ```shell
      gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [CLUSTER_ZONE]
      ```
      where:
      * `[CLUSTER_NAME]` is the name of the cluster for this app
      * `[CLUSTER_ZONE]` is the zone in which the cluster is operating

      For information on getting the credentials for a cluster, read the [Google Kubernetes Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart#get_authentication_credentials_for_the_cluster).
      Make sure that all components are in `ready` status.
      To connect to the Hazelcast service from your machine, you should use `curl`, or another HTTP client.

      Forward the Hazelcast service's client port to your machine:
      ```shell
      kubectl port-forward svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-svc --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} 5701
      ```
      Then, in a new terminal window, run the following commands:
      ```shell

      ## Put some value
      curl -X POST -d 'my-value' \
        'http://localhost:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/mykey'

      ## Get value
      curl 'http://localhost:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/mykey'
      ```
