      Cert Manager provides native Kubernetes automation for creating and managing TLS certificates.
      It has support for making self-signed certificates, using your own Certificate Authority (CA), and using external services such as Let’s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi.
      It also takes care of checking that certificates are valid and up-to-date, and attempts to renew certificates before they expire.

      # Deploy an Issuer and Cert request for self-signed certificate

      To deploy an Issuer instance, run the following command:

      ```shell
      kubectl apply --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -f - <<EOF
      apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
      kind: Issuer
      metadata:
        name: test-selfsigned
      spec:
        selfSigned: {}
      EOF
      ```

      To request a certificate, run the following command:

      ```shell
      kubectl apply --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -f - <<EOF
      apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
      kind: Certificate
