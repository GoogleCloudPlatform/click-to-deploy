      # Get authentication credentials for the cluster:

      ```shell
      gcloud container clusters get-credentials \
        [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [CLUSTER_ZONE]
      ```
      where:
      * `[CLUSTER_NAME]` is the name of the cluster for this app
      * `[CLUSTER_ZONE]` is the zone in which the cluster is operating

      For more information, read the [instructions for getting authentication credentials for the cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart#get_authentication_credentials_for_the_cluster).

      Make sure that all components are in `ready` status.

      Deployed service of {{ .Release.Name }} is ClusterIP type, so you can reach to {{ .Release.Name }} api within a kubernetes cluster.
