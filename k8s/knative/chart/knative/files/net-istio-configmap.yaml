    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # A gateway and Istio service to serve external traffic.
    # The configuration format should be
    # `gateway.{{gateway_namespace}}.{{gateway_name}}: "{{ingress_name}}.{{ingress_namespace}}.svc.cluster.local"`.
    # The {{gateway_namespace}} is optional; when it is omitted, the system will search for
    # the gateway in the serving system namespace `knative-serving`
    gateway.knative-serving.knative-ingress-gateway: "istio-ingressgateway.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local"

    # A cluster local gateway to allow pods outside of the mesh to access
    # Services and Routes not exposing through an ingress.  If the users
    # do have a service mesh setup, this isn't required and can be removed.
    #
    # An example use case is when users want to use Istio without any
    # sidecar injection (like Knative's istio-ci-no-mesh.yaml).  Since every pod
    # is outside of the service mesh in that case, a cluster-local  service
    # will need to be exposed to a cluster-local gateway to be accessible.
    # The configuration format should be `local-gateway.{{local_gateway_namespace}}.
    # {{local_gateway_name}}: "{{cluster_local_gateway_name}}.
    # {{cluster_local_gateway_namespace}}.svc.cluster.local"`. The
    # {{local_gateway_namespace}} is optional; when it is omitted, the system
    # will search for the local gateway in the serving system namespace
    # `knative-serving`

    # DEPRECATED: local-gateway.mesh is deprecated.
    # See: https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/11523
    #
    # To use only Istio service mesh and no knative-local-gateway, replace
    # all local-gateway.* entries by the following entry.
    local-gateway.mesh: "mesh"

    # If true, knative will use the Istio VirtualService's status to determine
    # endpoint readiness. Otherwise, probe as usual.
    # NOTE: This feature is currently experimental and should not be used in production.

  # TODO(nghia): Extract the .svc.cluster.local suffix into its own config.
