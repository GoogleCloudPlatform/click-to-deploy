# Installation

## Quick install with Google Cloud Marketplace

Get up and running with a few clicks! To install this Cert Manager app to a
Google Kubernetes Engine cluster via Google Cloud Marketplace, follow the
[on-screen instructions](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/google/cert-manager).

## Command-line instructions

### Prerequisites

#### Set up command-line tools

You'll need the following tools in your development environment. If you are
using Cloud Shell, then `gcloud`, `kubectl`, Docker, and Git are installed in
your environment by default.

- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [envsubst](https://command-not-found.com/envsubst)

Configure `gcloud` as a Docker credential helper:

```shell
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

#### Create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster

Create a new cluster from the command-line:

```shell
export CLUSTER=cert-manager-cluster
export ZONE=us-west1-a

gcloud container clusters create "${CLUSTER}" --zone "${ZONE}"
```

Configure `kubectl` to connect to the new cluster:

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials "${CLUSTER}" --zone "${ZONE}"
```

#### Clone this repo

Clone this repo, and its associated tools repo:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/click-to-deploy.git
```

#### Install the Application resource definition

An Application resource is a collection of individual Kubernetes components,
such as Services, Deployments, and so on, that you can manage as a group.

To set up your cluster to understand Application resources, run the following
command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-tools/master/crd/app-crd.yaml"
```

You need to run this command once.

The Application resource is defined by the
[Kubernetes SIG-apps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps)
community. You can find the source code at
[github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application).
