      Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting platform, widely adopted by many companies
      as a Kubernetes monitoring tool. In this application Prometheus is supported by Grafana,
      a highly customizable user interface providing a number of preinstalled dashboards visualizing
      the metrics collected by the Prometheus server.

      # Access Grafana UI

      Grafana is exposed in a ClusterP-only service `{{ .Release.Name }}-grafana`. To connect to
      Grafana UI, you can either expose a public service endpoint or keep it private, but connect
      from you local environment with `kubectl port-forward`.

      ## Forward Grafana port in local environment

      You can use port forwarding feature of `kubectl` to forward Grafana's port to your local
      machine. Run the following command in background:

      ```shell
      kubectl port-forward --namespace ${NAMESPACE} ${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}-grafana-0 3000
      ```

      Now you can access Grafana UI with `http://localhost:3000/`.

      ## Login to Grafana

      Grafana is configured to require authentication. You can find username and password in the
      'Prometheus & Grafana info' section on the left. They are stored in
      `{{ .Release.Name }}-grafana` secret.

      # Explore the GKE dashboards

      After logging in to Grafana UI, explore the preconfigured dashboards visualizing the metrics
      collected by Prometheus. Click on the `Home` button in the top left corner of Grafana homepage
      and you will be presented a list of available dashboards. Click on a selected dashboard to see
      its metrics visualization.
