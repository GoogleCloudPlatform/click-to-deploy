      # Access Prometheus UI

      Prometheus is exposed in a ClusterP-only service `{{ .Release.Name }}-prometheus`. To connect to
      Prometheus UI, you can either expose a public service endpoint or keep it private, but connect
      from you local environment with `kubectl port-forward`.

      ## Forward Prometheus port in local environment

      You can use port forwarding feature of `kubectl` to forward Grafana's port to your local
      machine. Run the following command in background:

      ```shell
      kubectl port-forward --namespace ${NAMESPACE} ${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}-prometheus-0 9090
      ```

      Now you can access Prometheus UI with `http://localhost:9090/`.
