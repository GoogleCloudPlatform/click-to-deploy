# Installation

## Quick install with Google Cloud Marketplace

Get up and running with a few clicks! Install this RabbitMQ app to a
Google Kubernetes Engine cluster using Google Cloud Marketplace. Follow the
[on-screen instructions](https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/google/rabbitmq).

## Command line instructions

### Prerequisites

#### Set up command-line tools

You'll need the following tools in your development environment:
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

#### Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster

Create a new cluster from the command-line.

```shell
export CLUSTER=marketplace-cluster
export ZONE=us-west1-a

gcloud container clusters create "$CLUSTER" --zone "$ZONE"
```

Configure `kubectl` to talk to the new cluster.

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$CLUSTER" --zone "$ZONE"
```

#### Clone this repo

Clone this repo and the associated tools repo.

```shell
gcloud source repos clone google-click-to-deploy --project=k8s-marketplace-eap
gcloud source repos clone google-marketplace-k8s-app-tools --project=k8s-marketplace-eap
```

#### Install the Application resource definition

Do a one-time setup for your cluster to understand Application resource via installing Application's Custom Resource Definition.

<!--
To do that, navigate to `k8s/vendor` subdirectory of the repository and run the following command:
-->

```shell
kubectl apply -f google-marketplace-k8s-app-tools/crd/*
```

The Application resource is defined by the
[Kubernetes SIG-apps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps)
community. The source code can be found on
[github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application).

### Install the Application

Navigate to the `rabbitmq` directory.

```shell
cd google-click-to-deploy/k8s/rabbitmq
```

#### Configure the app with environment variables

Choose the instance name and namespace for the app.

```shell
export APP_INSTANCE_NAME=rabbitmq-1
export NAMESPACE=default
```

Set the number of replicas.

```shell
export REPLICAS=3
```

Set or generate the [Erlang cookie](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#erlang-cookie). The cookie has be encoded in base64.

```shell
export RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1 | tr -d '\n' | base64)
```

Set username of the app.

```shell
export RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=rabbit
```

Set or generate the password. The value has to be encoded in base64.

```shell
export RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 12 | head -n 1 | tr -d '\n' | base64)
```

Configure the container images.

```shell
TAG=3.7
export IMAGE_RABBITMQ=gcr.io/k8s-marketplace-eap/google/rabbitmq:${TAG}
export IMAGE_RABBITMQ_INIT=gcr.io/k8s-marketplace-eap/google/rabbitmq/debian9:${TAG}
```

The images above are referenced by
[tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag). It is strongly
recommended to pin each image to an immutable
[content digest](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#content-digests).
This will ensure that the installed application will always use the same images,
until you are ready to upgrade.

```shell
for i in "IMAGE_RABBITMQ IMAGE_RABBITMQ_INIT"; do
  repo=`echo ${!i} | cut -d: -f1`;
  digest=`docker pull ${!i} | sed -n -e 's/Digest: //p'`;
  export $i="$repo@$digest";
  env | grep $i;
done
```

#### Prerequisites for using Role-Based Access Control

You must grant your user the ability to create roles in Kubernetes by running the following command. You have to do it **once** for the cluster. [Read more](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control)

```shell
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole cluster-admin \
  --user $(gcloud config get-value account)
```

#### Expand the manifest template

Use `envsubst` to expand the template. It is recommended that you save the
expanded manifest file for future updates to the application.

```shell
awk 'BEGINFILE {print "---"}{print}' manifest/* \
  | envsubst '$APP_INSTANCE_NAME $NAMESPACE $IMAGE_RABBITMQ $IMAGE_RABBITMQ_INIT $REPLICAS $RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE $RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER $RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS' \
  > "${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}_manifest.yaml"
```

#### Apply to Kubernetes

Use `kubectl` to apply the manifest to your Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
kubectl apply -f "${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}_manifest.yaml" --namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
```

#### View the app in the Google Cloud Console

Point your browser to:

```shell
echo "https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/application/${ZONE}/${CLUSTER}/${NAMESPACE}/${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}"
```

#### Cluster status

By default, the application does not have an external IP. Use `kubectl` to execute `rabbitmqctl` on the master node.

```
kubectl exec -it "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq-0" --namespace "$NAMESPACE" -- rabbitmqctl cluster_status
```

#### Authorization

The default username is `rabbit`. Use `kubectl` to get the generated password.

```shell
kubectl get secret $APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq-secret \
  --namespace $NAMESPACE \
  --output=jsonpath='{.data.rabbitmq-pass}' | base64 --decode
```

#### Expose RabbitMQ service (optional)

By default, the application does not have an external IP. Run the
following command to expose an external IP:

> **NOTE:** It might take some time for the external IP to be provisioned.

```
kubectl patch svc "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq-svc" \
  --namespace "$NAMESPACE" \
  --patch '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

#### Access RabbitMQ service

**Option 1:** To discover IP addresses of RabbitMQ service using `kubectl`, run the following command:

```
kubectl get svc $APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq-svc --namespace $NAMESPACE
```

**Option 2:** If you run your RabbitMQ cluster behind a LoadBalancer, run the command below to get an external IP of the RabbitMQ service:

```
SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc $APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq-svc \
  --namespace $NAMESPACE \
  --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
echo "http://${SERVICE_IP}:15672"
```

Navigate http://`<EXTERNAL-IP>`:15672 to access RabbitMQ Management UI. Where `<EXTERNAL-IP>` is provided by command above.

**Option 3:** Use Port Forwarding:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq-svc --namespace $NAMESPACE 15672
```

Navigate http://127.0.0.1:15672 to access RabbitMQ Management UI.

**Option 4:** If you would like to get cluster IP and external IP addressses of RabbitMQ service using Python you could use the following code:

```python
import os

# if kubernetes module is not installed, please, install it, e.g. pip install kubernetes
from kubernetes import client, config

# Load Kube config
config.load_kube_config()

# Create a Kubernetes client
k8s_client = client.CoreV1Api()

# Get the list of all pods
service = k8s_client.read_namespaced_service(namespace="default", name="rabbitmq-1-rabbitmq-svc")

print("Cluster IP: {}\n".format(service.spec.cluster_ip))

for item in service.status.load_balancer.ingress:
  print("External IP: {}\n".format(item.ip))
```

If you would like to send and receive messages to RabbitMQ using Python [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html) is a good reference how to do that.

# Scaling

## Scale the cluster up

By default, RabbitMQ K8s application is deployed using 3 replicas.
Scale the number of replicas up by the following command:

```
kubectl scale statefulsets "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq" \
  --namespace "$NAMESPACE" --replicas=<new-replicas>
```
where `<new-replicas>` defines the new desired number.

## Scale the cluster down

**Option 1:** Use `kubectl` to scale down by following command:

This option reduces the number of replicas without disconnecting nodes from the cluster. Scaling down will also leave `persistentvolumeclaims` of your StatefulSet untouched.

```
kubectl scale statefulsets "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq" \
  --namespace "$NAMESPACE" --replicas=<new-replicas>
```
where `<new-replicas>` defines the new desired number.

**Option 2:** Remove a RabbitMQ node permanently:

> **WARNING:** This option deletes `persistentvolumeclaims` permanently, which results in permanent data loss from the deleted Pods.
> Consider enabling HA mode to replicate data between all nodes before you start the procedure.

To remove a RabbitMQ node permanently and scale down the number of replicas, please use script `scripts/scale-down.sh` with `--help` argument to get more information,
or manually scale down the cluster in following steps.

To manually remove a nodes from the cluster, and then Pod from K8s,
start from highest numbered Pod.

For each node, do following steps:
1. Run `rabbitmqctl stop_app` and `rabbitmqctl reset` commands on RabbitMQ container
1. Scale down StatefulSet by one with `kubectl scale sts` command
1. Wait until Pod is removed from StatefulSet
1. Remove Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claim belonging to that replica

Repeat this procedure until RabbitMQ cluster has expected number of Pods.

---

For more information about the StatefulSets scaling, check the
[Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/scale-stateful-set/#kubectl-scale).

For more information about removing a node from RabbitMQ cluster, check the [official documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#breakup).

# Backup and restore

Read the [official documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/backup.html) for more information.

# Update procedure

For more background about the rolling update procedure, check the [Upgrading RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) guide.

Start with assigning a new image to your StatefulSet definition:

```shell
kubectl set image statefulset "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq" \
  rabbitmq=<put-your-new-image-reference-here>
```

where `<put-your-new-image-reference-here>` is the new image.

To check that the Pods in the StatefulSet running the `rabbitmq` container are updating, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=$APP_INSTANCE_NAME -w
```

The Pods in the StatefulSet are updated in reverse ordinal order.
The StatefulSet controller terminates each Pod, and waits for it to transition to `Running` and `Ready` prior to updating the next Pod.
The final state of the Pods should be `Running` and marked as `1/1` in **READY** column.

To check the current image used for `rabbitmq` container, you can run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get statefulsets "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-rabbitmq" \
  --namespace "$NAMESPACE" \
  --output jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
```

# Uninstall the Application

## Using GKE UI

Navigate to `GKE > Applications` in GCP console. From the list of applications, click on the one
that you wish to uninstall.

On the new screen, click on the `Delete` button located in the top menu. It will remove
the resources attached to this application.

## Using the command line

### Prepare the environment

Set your installation name and Kubernetes namespace:

```shell
export APP_INSTANCE_NAME=rabbitmq-1
export NAMESPACE=default
```

### Delete the resources

> **NOTE:** Please keep in mind that `kubectl` guarantees support for Kubernetes server in +/- 1 versions.
> It means that for instance if you have `kubectl` in version 1.10.&ast; and Kubernetes 1.8.&ast;,
> you may experience incompatibility issues, like not removing the StatefulSets with
> apiVersion of apps/v1beta2.

If you still have the expanded manifest file used for the installation, you can use it to delete the resources.
Run `kubectl` on expanded manifest file matching your installation:

```shell
kubectl delete -f ${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}_manifest.yaml --namespace $NAMESPACE
```

Otherwise, delete the resources by indication of types and a label:

```shell
kubectl delete statefulset,secret,service,configmap,serviceaccount,role,rolebinding,application \
  --namespace $NAMESPACE \
  --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=$APP_INSTANCE_NAME
```

### Delete the persistent volumes of your installation

By design, removal of StatefulSets in Kubernetes does not remove the PersistentVolumeClaims that
were attached to their Pods. It protects your installations from mistakenly deleting stateful data.

If you wish to remove the PersistentVolumeClaims with their attached persistent disks, run the
following `kubectl` commands:

```shell
for pv in $(kubectl get pvc --namespace $NAMESPACE \
  --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=$APP_INSTANCE_NAME \
  --output jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.volumeName}');
do
  kubectl delete pv/$pv --namespace $NAMESPACE
done

kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaims \
  --namespace $NAMESPACE \
  --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=$APP_INSTANCE_NAME
```

### Delete GKE cluster

Optionally, if you do not need both the deployed application and GKE cluster used for deployment then you can delete the whole GKE cluster using this command:

```shell
export CLUSTER=marketplace-cluster
export ZONE=us-west1-a
```

```
gcloud container clusters delete "$CLUSTER" --zone "$ZONE"
```
