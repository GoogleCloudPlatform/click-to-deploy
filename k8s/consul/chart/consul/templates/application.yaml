      # Get authentication credentials for the cluster

      ```shell
      gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [CLUSTER_ZONE]
      ```
      where:
      * `[CLUSTER_NAME]` is the name of this application's cluster
      * `[CLUSTER_ZONE]` is the zone in which that cluster is operating

      Read more about authentication credentials [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart#get_authentication_credentials_for_the_cluster) for more information.

      # Get access to the Consul UI

      Run the following command to start port forwarding:

      ```shell
      kubectl port-forward svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-consul-ui --namespace {{ .Values.namespace }} 8500:80
      ```

      Then, access the Consul UI by using the following link: [http://localhost:8500](http://localhost:8500)

      # Get access to the Consul API at every Kubernetes node, localy

      By default, Consul clients run on every Kubernetes node in cluster.
      To access the Consul client port, you can connect directly to HOST_IP:8500

      Value of hostIP can be provided as environment in container:

      ```shell
      env:
        - name: HOST_IP
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: status.hostIP
      ```
