      Memcached is an open source in-memory, key-value store.

      Key features of this solution include high performance and ease of distribution.

      Although Memcached is intended to be use with dynamic web applications, it can be used as
      a caching system for a number of databases.

    notes: |-
      # Access Memcached instances

      Activate Google Cloud Shell or use other environment where you have kubectl configured in appropriate way.

      Identify the cluster where your application was deployed and run the following command:
      ```shell
      gcloud container clusters get-credentials <your cluster> --zone <zone where your cluster was created>
      ```
      You can get this information from Kubernetes Engine->Clusters tab.

      Run the following command to discover IP addresses of Memcached instances using kubectl:

      ```shell
      kubectl get pods -o wide -l app.kubernetes.io/name={{ .Release.Name }} --namespace "{{ .Release.Namespace }}"
      ```

      # Scale the cluster

      Activate Google Cloud Shell.

      Identify the cluster where your application was deployed and run the following command:
      ```shell
      gcloud container clusters get-credentials <your cluster> --zone <zone where your cluster was created>
      ```
      You can get this information from Kubernetes Engine->Clusters tab.

      To scale the cluster, use either a GKE UI (use the Scale option in the
      StatefulSet details screen) or the following command:

      ```
      kubectl scale statefulsets "{{ .Release.Name }}-memcached" \
        --namespace "{{ .Release.Namespace }}" --replicas=<new-replicas>
      ```
